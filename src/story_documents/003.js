    <p className="quote">“I told myself never to wear the typical face of widowhood. In my tribute to my late husband, I promised to do him proud…that promise I made kept me strong in the face of every adversity I faced.”</p>
    <h2>The Experience</h2>
    <p>In 2006, she lost her husband in a tragic plane crash and was left to nurse a toddler and a pregnancy. In the wake of this tragic loss, she summoned the courage to re-write the story of her life. For starters, she decided to quit her lucrative bank job and explore a new life. Her next step was to enroll at the Leeds Business School to widen her leadership and business skill. While there, she learnt about entrepreneurs like Richard Branson who created global brands from almost nothing. This educational experience ignited the entrepreneurial spirit within her, and she decided to start her own company.</p>
    <h2>The Steps To Success</h2>
    <p>In 2011, she created Zaron, a cosmetics company that focused on beauty product for dark skinned women, particularly Nigerian women. Her journey to significance was not without struggles because in recapping her story she said: “My mother was in tears when I was leaving but I told her that I had to move to the next phase because Port Harcourt reminds me of pain it was where I lost my husband.”<br/> Within three years of creation, Zaron products started competing with international brands like Avon, Vogue, Olay and others. Today the brand has retail outlets in countries like the UK, USA and Ghana. The company also has about 26 outlets in twelve cities in Nigeria, and over 800 distributors in Nigeria alone.</p>
