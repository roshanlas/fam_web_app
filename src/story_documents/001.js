    <p className="quote">“I was very young when my mother became pregnant, and she was feeling terrible pain, and i didn’t know how to help her and my mother died in front of my eyes, so I decided to be a doctor”</p>
    <h2>The Experience</h2>
    <p>Born in 1944 in Kano State, Nigeria to the family of Felix Ebelechukwu and Margaret Modebelu who were both from Nnewi, Anambra State, Dr Stella attended her All Saints Primary School in Onitsha and Federal Science Secondary School in Lagos.

Upon starting up, many people wondered if she knew what she was getting herself into as it was rare to see women venture into manufacturing business in Nigeria especially not the Pharmaceutical space as at that time.
