    <p className="quote">“I don’t want to be seen as a disabled person, but even if people see me that way, I don’t want it to define me”</p>
    <h2>The Experience</h2>
    <p>Amina was a successful communications executive and a mother with four children and life offered greater prospect until she had a fatal accident during a vacation. Her life was saved but she would be committed to a wheelchair due to the accident that left her paralyzed. When she returned back to Morocco, her experience made her begin to see the challenges of persons with disability in her country. Morocco has little support or government assistance for people living with disabilities. Almost 10% of the population is physically challenged, whilst 78% of those of working age that are disabled are unemployed. She became concerned about the lack of care, infrastructure and adequate medical care for persons with similar cases like hers. Moved with empathy, she decided to do something about it by starting a company to address the issues facing persons with disability.</p>

    <p>In 1992, with personal resources, Amina started the AHM Group which works in different but interrelated areas to rehabilitate and reintegrate vulnerable people and persons with disability back into society, through health, social services, vocational training, enterprise development and lobbying.

AHM Group employs over 200 professionals, offers services to over 2,000 persons annually and has so far impacted over 26,000 beneficiaries. Amina has received many awards including the Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur in 2006. She also sits on the boards of several associations fighting for human rights. She may be on a wheelchair but her impact on humanity is unlimited as she continues to touch lives and inspire hope in thousands of persons through her positive outlook to life.</p>
